                                    The Commonwealth Bank is set to reduce its workforce by nearly 200 positions this month, contributing to a total loss of over a thousand jobs within the company over the past year. The Financial Sector Union (FSU) has officially confirmed that 192 jobs will be eliminated from the bank's back-office operations in Sydney, Melbourne, and Perth due to an "automation initiative."

                                    The union has provided details on the breakdown of job losses, with 87 positions being cut from the Commonwealth Bank's home buying operations division, 47 from consumer finance, and 21 from the everyday banking team. Additionally, CBA-owned BankWest will see a reduction of nine staff members in its lending arm.

                                            These job cuts have been prompted by a decline in retail banking over the past 12 months, affecting both the everyday banking and home buying operations teams. The bank has stated to the FSU that "automation initiatives" in these areas have allowed for a more streamlined process, necessitating fewer workers.

                                    According to the union, Commonwealth Bank has now eliminated 1085 jobs in the past year. In response to these changes, the bank has expressed its commitment to assisting affected employees by focusing on redeployment efforts. They emphasize that they have hired "more than 10,000 people" since 2021, adding to their existing workforce of 50,000.
                                    <br>
                                    A spokesperson for CBA stated, "As part of our focus on continuous business improvement, we regularly assess the skills we require and our organizational structure. This means that some roles may change or become redundant from time to time. These decisions are never taken lightly, and our top priority is to treat every individual with respect and care. We work closely with impacted employees to understand their individual circumstances and assist them in finding opportunities and developing skills to support their transition to another role within or outside the bank."
                                    <br>
                                    Julia Angrisano, the National Secretary of the FSU, criticized the decision to further reduce the workforce, especially considering that CBA reported a full-year profit of $10.18 billion. She expressed concern that the bank appears to be prioritizing cost-cutting and profit enhancement over retaining its employees.
                                    <br>
                                    Angrisano also highlighted that most of the job losses affect experienced staff and noted that Commonwealth Bank is grappling with staff shortages and excessive workloads. She questioned the bank's ability to afford losing a significant number of experienced employees while simultaneously facing organizational challenges related to overwork.

                                    <br>
                                    The Commonwealth Bank is planning to cut nearly 200 jobs as part of an automation initiative, bringing the total job losses at the bank to over a thousand in the past year. The job cuts will impact various divisions, including home buying operations, consumer finance, and everyday banking, as well as a subsidiary, BankWest. The bank cites automation as the reason for these reductions, which come in response to a downturn in retail banking. Despite posting a substantial profit, the bank is facing criticism for making these job cuts, particularly among experienced staff, while struggling with staff shortages and excessive workloads.

                                            <b>What I say,</b><br>
                                            When a lot of people lose their jobs, it can cause problems for the economy. People who are out of work spend less money, which hurts businesses, especially those that rely on customers buying things. This can lead to more businesses struggling and even closing, which means more people losing their jobs. <br>
                                            The government also has to spend more money on helping unemployed people, which can make things tough for the government's finances and slow down the overall economy. High job losses can even lead to the economy shrinking, more people going bankrupt or losing their homes, and affect how stable the housing and financial markets are. <br> 
                                            To fix these issues, the government might need to step in with measures like helping people get new jobs, giving them financial support, and boosting the economy with extra money. Job losses can also have other negative effects like making people forget their skills, causing problems in the job market, and influencing how people feel about the government and politics, and it can make people feel stressed and upset.
