                                    Western suburbs ‘kids’ who can’t afford their own homes are contributing to a big rise in granny flat builds.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    And Granny Flats WA director Mike Nicholls said marriage breakdowns, with either the son or daughter moving back home with a parent, was another driving factor.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    “That is very much a trend,” Mr Nicholls said.
                                    <br>
                                    “We are experiencing a range of factors that have come together at the same time, leading to a spike in interest and builds.”
                                    <br>
                                    Mr Nicholls said orders had almost tripled since the State Government slashed red tape in April. He said the rental and housing crisis and relaxed rules on building granny flats had also supercharged the industry.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    The changes, announced by Planning Minister John Carey, allow granny flats to be built on homes with strata titles and on blocks less than 350 square metres.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    The dwellings no longer need council planning approval but still require council-issued building permits. Mr Nicholls said the whole of the Perth metropolitan area had seen a rise in granny flat builds.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    However, suburbs around Claremont and Nedlands were an “accelerated zone” due to the rental crisis. “The major trigger for that is children in those homes cannot afford to buy locally, so they are instead living in their parents’ backyards,” he said.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    A recent Finder survey of 1070 Australians found one in nine West Australians had moved back home, with spokesperson Sarah Megginson saying high interest rates and cost of living pressures had driven many to return to mum and dad.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Mr Nicholls said the changes which attracted the most attention were allowing granny flats on strata titles and smaller blocks as well as the dropping of the requirement to provide a parking bay with the flat.

                                    <br>
                                    “We were signing about 70 contracts per year and we are now on track for about 200 per year,” he said.

                                    Mr Nicholls said granny flats were being built to a higher standard and seen as a small home rather than a “compromise”. “Granny flats are now part of landscaping for new homes, in a similar way that a swimming pool was a standard part of planning in the Boomer generation — now everyone has a granny flat,” he said.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    “They are being planned for as something that can generate income, instead of being whacked in after.” Mr Carey said the advice of industry showed the reforms were clearly having a positive impact on boosting housing supply. He said the reforms to ancillary dwellings were implemented to boost housing supply and choice.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    “The Cook Labor Government continues to lead the nation in driving planning reforms that cut unnecessary red tape to accelerate the delivery of housing across the State,” the minister said. “By removing significant red tape, such as the minimum lot size and the requirement of granny flats to look like the existing dwelling, more granny flats will now be R-Code compliant and will not require time-consuming planning approvals.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    “These reforms make it easier for mum and dads providing more housing options at their existing home, saving them time and money, while delivering affordable, efficient and suitable housing options.”
