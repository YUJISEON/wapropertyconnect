                                    The Commonwealth Bank is set to reduce its workforce by nearly 200 positions this month, contributing to a total loss of over a thousand jobs within the company over the past year. The Financial Sector Union (FSU) has officially confirmed that 192 jobs will be eliminated from the bank's back-office operations in Sydney, Melbourne, and Perth due to an "automation initiative."

                                    The union has provided details on the breakdown of job losses, with 87 positions being cut from the Commonwealth Bank's home buying operations division, 47 from consumer finance, and 21 from the everyday banking team. Additionally, CBA-owned BankWest will see a reduction of nine staff members in its lending arm.
